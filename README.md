# PrivateLLM
PrivateLLM is a C++ application designed for secure, local interaction with large language models (LLMs). It allows users to send prompts to a locally hosted LLM, manage conversational context, and handle memory for continuous, dynamic conversations. PrivateLLM prioritizes privacy, ensuring that all interactions are processed locally.
